# FDF 
Wireframe model

FdF, short for "Fil de Fer" (English: "Wireframe"), is a programming project from the 42 school curriculum. The primary goal of this project is to render an isometric view of a map to achieve a 3D effect, similar to what is utilized in video games. As a secondary objective, I have implemented an informational menu, spherical projection, and translation across all axes.

## Introduction
The core objective of this project is the isometric rendering of a map, creating a 3D visual effect akin to that used in video games. To enhance the functionality and user experience, I've also incorporated an information menu, spherical projection, and the ability to translate the view around all axes.

## Features
This FdF project comes with a range of features, including:

Isometric Rendering: Provides a 3D view of the map using isometric projection.
Information Menu: An interactive menu that displays key controls and information to the user.
Spherical Projection: An additional projection method that offers a different perspective on the data.
Axis Translation: Allows the user to translate the view around the X, Y, and Z axes for comprehensive visualization.
Interactive Controls: Users can interact with the map through a variety of controls to zoom, move, and rotate the view.

## Installation and Usage
To get started with this FdF project, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository: git@github.com:CapSte42/fdf.git
- Compile with Make: Run the command make from the project's root directory.
- Download Maps: Execute make maps to download existing maps.
- Run the Program: Use ./fdf maps/[map name.fdf] to start the program with your chosen map.

## Available Commands
Enhance your experience and interaction with the FdF project using these commands:

- Left Click: Move the map.
- Scroll: Zoom in/out.
- Left/Right Arrows: Rotate around the Y axis.
- Up/Down Arrows: Rotate around the X axis.
- A/D Keys: Rotate around the Z axis.
- +/- Keys: Adjust the map's height.
- R Key: Reset the map's height to its original state.
- Right Click: Change the projection mode.
- Space Bar: Reset the view to its default state.
- H Key: Hide or show the information menu.
- G Key: Toggle spherical projection.
This set of controls is designed to offer a comprehensive and immersive way to explore and interact with the 3D maps rendered by the FdF program.
